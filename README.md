# Close Encounters of the Jeff Kind
Lila-Pause GameJam event on Ludum Dare 53.

A bullet hell where players take on the role of Jeff, the last remaining packet deliverer for the human resistance in an alien invasion. As Jeff navigates through a barrage of alien attacks, players must collect and deliver important packets before time runs out.

Jeff is protected by his trusty titan armor in 80s style, making him invulnerable to enemy attacks. However, every time Jeff is hit by an alienâ€™s bullet, he is stunned, making it more challenging for players to deliver packets in time. Players must strategize and dodge enemy bullets while keeping their eyes on the ticking clock.

With no end in sight, players must strive to deliver as many packets as they can to increase their final score. But be warned, if too many packets vanish, the game is lost, and the human resistance is doomed. Can you rise to the challenge and become the savior of humanity?
